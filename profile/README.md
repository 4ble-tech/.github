## Who we are

Hi, this is Able Tech. We are an **independent, high-schooler-run initiative** that aims to create software solutions for any group of people needing help in our community for **free**.

Today on Long Island, over one million people have a mental illness. Many of these individuals face challenges in their daily lives, such as difficulty with communication, navigation, memorization, etc. And we realized that software solutions could help to address these challenges and improve the quality of life for people with mental illness. Whether it is an improved communication or memory aid, we want to improve the lives of people with difficulties for the better of our community.
